Makerdata is a tool to visualize data in the browser. 

Developed by Nick Benoit for Cache Makers:

Essentially Makerdata keeps an array of values, scaling to either fit all data points on the screen or the last N 
(set in initialization). Makerdata scales data to fill the entire viewport in an attempt to make minute changes in 
atmospheric data more visually interesting to kids. 

This tool was initially developed to visualize weather data from a weather station, but easily be used to visualze any array 
of values. 



Questions or comments welocomed. 

Happy Coding!
